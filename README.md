- Examine the code at that line, and if it matches the problematic code snippet, replace it with the following corrected code:

```php
// Bail early if $image_meta['file'] is not set or an image has been inserted and later edited.
if ( isset( $image_meta['file'] )
&& preg_match( '/-e[0-9]{13}/', $image_meta['file'], $img_edit_hash )
&& strpos( wp_basename( $image_src ), $img_edit_hash[0] ) === false
) {
return $image;
}
```

- Make sure to save the changes after replacing the code. This adjustment aims to resolve the issue related to the undefined array key. After completing this step, check if the warning persists on your WordPress website.
